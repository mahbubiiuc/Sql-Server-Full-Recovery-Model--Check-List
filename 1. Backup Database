BACKUP DATABASE MINTDB TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\MINTDB_Full.bak' WITH INIT, COMPRESSION, STATS = 5;




WITH INIT means:
"Initialize the backup file" â€” i.e., overwrite the existing .bak file if it already exists.

WITH STATS = X option tells SQL Server to display progress messages during the backup or restore operation.
X is a percentage value (e.g., 10 means report every 10%).

WITH COMPRESSION tells SQL Server to compress the backup file to save disk space.
So instead of writing a full-size .bak file, SQL Server compresses it on the fly during the backup process.
